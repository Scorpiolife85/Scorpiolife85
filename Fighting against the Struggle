- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Scorpiolife85, and I just want to say that First, I am so sorry about the length of this information,but me and some of the people that are going through this problem are sick and tired of people who think they can bully other people around just because they are your bosses, and think that they are better than everyone else, because they are the boss and can use it to make people feel like they are inadequate or something like that, and that they are nothing but trash, and so these so called bosses harass you at work and sometimes even after work, because of something someone told them about you and they automatically believe it to be true,or because you live in a very bad neighborhood and they think that you are a bad person and therefore they think that you won't try fighting back because you were afraid of getting fired.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in learning how to legally fight against Bully's, I'm sorry please allow me to Clarify what I am talking about, I mean, The Bully's that I am referring to are, Certain Employers that think they are above the law, and So continues to harass his employees, Starting and not limited with starting arguments with you to see how you react, and then by doing everything they can do, to get you to do something stupid so that you get into trouble for it and then they have a legit reason to fire you,and really all to make your life harder and more complicated because it is funny to them, so they use any and all information about you or your situation to make fun of you or belittle you in front of other employees to embarrass you just for spite, they're only doing this, because they don't like you, or because of where you stay, or because of what you wear, and because they think that they are better than you because they found out that you were in prison because you made a mistake when you were younger and was convicted and sentenced to 14 years in Prison for something someone else lied and said I robbed them, and at the time they said that I committed the crime I was literally 2 counties over building a house with a friend who needed help because they were disabled and couldn't, but because they were cousins to the sheriff I was arrested and Convicted for a crime I never even could've, and or would've committed because I wasn't even in the same county at the time,
but I still served 14 years in Prison for it,and because of that Society labels me as a menace to society and will forever be labeled as a convicted felon for the rest of my life, all for a crime I didn't commit, and so when people learn stuff like that they automatically Consider you a screw up, and a trouble maker. So they, try starting problems with you  everyday, by harassing you everyday to try and make you do something that you know will end up badly for nobody else but you. So, instead of confronting these people about it, you just decided to keep it in, and continue to do the job, because you have already complained to corporate about it and they didn't do anything, So what else can I do but take the abuse, I need the job very badly, because I have kids and a wife to support, and this was the only place that would Hire me, so I had no choice.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning that the patience that I have acquired over the years isn't going to be enough because I'm trying to figure out how to legally and non violently do something about what is going on at my job and with some of the Management Staff that's doing this stuff to people and getting away with it, but I don't think I am going to be able to keep it together much longer if something is not done about it soon.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate, and maybe get someone else's insight on how and they think that I can get some help with this very important and very troubling issue that I've been dealing with recently on ways that I can fight against this issue
- üì´ If anyone has any ideals or information that can help me with figuring out on how or what I can do to help with this Issue, Please feel free to contact me at my personal email address, I and several other people that is going through this wants to thank you greatly just for taking the time to read this,and we pray that if you decide to help,that we are greatly appreciative of any help, and expertise that you can provide us with in fighting back against Bully's and those people who are oppressing people just because they think they can, so thanks for your time and patience in this matter.
 and I hope you have a Blessed Day.
